## Description
For this assignment, you will be asked to develop an Android app that displays a list of items using ListView. The user should be able to click on an item to view its details in a separate activity. The app should use explicit intent to navigate between activities and pass information between them. When the user clicks on an item, a visual notification should be triggered, displaying the item's details in a Toast or Snackbar.

## Requirements
1. The app should have a main activity that displays a list of items using ListView. Each item should have a title and a subtitle.
2. The app should use a data model class to represent each item in the list.
3. The app should use an Adapter class to populate the ListView with the list items.
4. The app should implement an OnClickListener to handle clicks on the list items.
5. When the user clicks on an item, the app should use explicit intent to navigate to a second activity that displays the details of the item.
6. The second activity should receive the data model object for the clicked item as an intent extra.
7. The second activity should display the item's details, including the title, subtitle, and any other relevant information.
8. When the user returns to the main activity from the second activity, the app should display a Toast/Snackbar indicating that the operation occurred successfully.
## Bonus Features
* Add an image to each item in the list.
* Replace the Toast with a Snackbar.
## Deliverables
* The source code for the Android app.
* A brief write-up explaining the key design decisions and challenges faced during the development process.
* A video demonstrating the app's functionality.
## Grading Criteria
* Completion of the requirements listed above (60%).
* Code quality, including readability, organization, and best practices (20%).
* Creativity and innovation in the design and implementation of the app (20%).
